    <h2>Engineering <i class="fa fa-gears"></i></h2>
    <p>Users are able to see mechanical objects in front of them using augmented reality. This could help greatly with prototyping and installation.<sup>1</sup>
    Rather than spending time and money on a physical component or machine, engineers are now able to create or modify their projects through an augmented reality device.
    In fact: the first official augmented reality program was created and used by <a href="http://www.boeing.com/" title="Go to Boeing official website">Boeing</a> 
    in order to instruct their employees on how to install airplane parts.<sup>2</sup>
