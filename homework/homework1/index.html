        This is a website for homework 1. It is about Augmented Reality. All examples come from the 
        Microsoft Hololens because that particular product currently has the best examples of my subjects.

        <p>Augmented Reality is the technology that allows for a user to see the physical world with virtual elements mixed in.
         The example of an augmented reality platform that I will use for this project is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens" title="Go to Microsoft Hololens official website">Microsoft Hololens</a>
        because it contains impressive software on the subjects that I will cover.
        <strong>(NOTE: </strong>Microsoft refers to the Hololens as a "mixed reality" device for marketing purposes, however I will still refer to it as augmented reality since it meets the criteria.)</p>
